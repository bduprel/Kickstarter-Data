#Kickstarting with Excel

##Overview of Project:

Data was provided and organized to see the different outcomes of fundraised events. These events were filtered down to plays as to make the data more directly comparable. There was also a focused filter on the dates of the fundraisers as well as the duration of the fundraisers as to best help Louise to know how long to run hers. 
To even better aid Lousie, there was a specific look at some of her favorite plays by looking at the goal amount, how much was raised, number of backers, and the average amount donated. 
To finalize the analysis, data was filtered to see the success rate of plays of varying goal sizes and presented as a line graph to be as digestible as possible.  

###Analysis and Challenges:
	This data was filtered through to be as comparable as possible to Lousieâ€™s goal so she could best organize her fund-raising program to meet her goal. The types of filtering were; seeing the amount of successful U.S. kickstarters, number of kickstarters for theatre-based events, mean and median goal amounts of kickstarters, and how long the kickstarters ran for. 
There were challenges with this assignment. Primarily finding and filtering the outcomes based on goals that were organized by dollar amount. This was a new formula to me and took some time to adjust to. There were errors in how the formula was entered and copied over to other cells. But I was able to comb through the cells to find and correct the mistakes. 

####Results:

After organizing and reviewing the data there are couple of conclusions that can be made. The first one is, the months May, June and July had the highest number of successfully reached goals. With May being the highest at 111 successfully reached goals out of 166 that were started in this month. So, it does seem like May is the best month to launch a crowdfunded goal. But this month also had the highest number of failed goals at 52. It does seem the best month to start in, but also a crowded field. 
December had the least amount of successfully reached goals at 37 out of 75 total. It had 35 fails. As this data was filtered down to just the U.S. it would make sense this month would see the least amount of success as a start point as many families are likely budgeting for the holiday season. 
Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:

The data filtered by outcomes based on goals shows that it is much more likely to reach the goal if it is set under $5000. The two groups at this range (under $1000 and $1000 to $4999) saw a success rate of 76% and 73% respectively. They were also the two most populated ranges. The next highest amounts were $30000 to $34999 and $35000 to $39999 at 67% each. However, they have much smaller populations at six and three respectively, so the percentages are somewhat misleading.

#####Summary of Limitations:
	Although this was a large dataset, there are still things that could be added to it. The first one that comes to mind is to be even more specific with the location of where the plays will be performed. For example, in the U.S. the densest market for live plays would be in New York. So it would make sense on the surface that this would be the best place to say the play will be performed if wanting to raise funds, however, this may also be a crowded market and make it harder for a certain play to stand out. If the locations of where the plays were also provided, the data could be used to track the locations with higher success rates that are not as crowded. This would point to there being more demand for plays than there are plays being provided. 
	It would so be interesting to see how many tickets were sold after the funds were successfully raised. This could be helpful to track how well what type of plays are preferred and could be used to better set expectations for the type of play someone would be looking to raise funds for.
